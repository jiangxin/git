AGIT Release Notes
==================

v0.1.0
------
* New command 'git-quiltexport' to export commits to quilt patches.
* Prohibit to write to repo if there is a 'agit-repo.lock' file at any upword directory.
* Touch a '.git/info/last-modified' file after write to repo.
* In order to support centralize workflow like gerrit in git, add a `.git/hooks/execute-commands`
  hook.  If user has set `receive.executeCommandsRefs` config variables, git will check and mark
  commands, and run external hook instead of internal functions on marked commands.
